> accurate and verifiable values, derived from elemental compositions,
> for the mass differences introduced by all types of natural and
> artificial modifications. Other important information includes any
> mass change, (neutral loss), that occurs during MS/MS analysis, and
> site specificity, (which residues are susceptible to modification and
> any constraints on the position of the modification within the protein
> or peptide).
