Managing amino acid modifications for mass spectrometry in `R`. 

Unimod is a public domain database, distributed under a

The aim is to create a community supported, comprehensive database of
protein modifications for mass spectrometry applications. That is,
accurate and verifiable values, derived from elemental compositions,
for the mass differences introduced by all types of natural and
artificial modifications. Other important information includes any
mass change, (neutral loss), that occurs during MS/MS analysis, and
site specificity, (which residues are susceptible to modification and
any constraints on the position of the modification within the protein
or peptide).
